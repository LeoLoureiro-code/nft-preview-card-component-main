## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

In this project I learned about how to make content visible using the :hover pseudo-class and the visibility css property.

Example using in my project

``
.imgDiv:hover .hoverImageDiv{
    visibility: visible;
    cursor: pointer;
}
``



### Continued development

In future projects I wanted to learn about using the hover pseudo-class to create another divs or lists un a nav menu and apply them in my previous projects to improve them.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) - This helped me to understand the hover pseudo-class.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/css-visibility.php) - This page helped me undestand the difference between the css properties display and visibility.
