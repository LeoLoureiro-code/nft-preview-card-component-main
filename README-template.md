# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

In this project I learned about how to make content visible using the :hover pseudo-class and the visibility css property.

Example using in my project

``
.imgDiv:hover .hoverImageDiv{
    visibility: visible;
    cursor: pointer;
}
``



### Continued development

In future projects I wanted to learn about using the hover pseudo-class to create another divs or lists un a nav menu and apply them in my previous projects to improve them.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp) - This helped me to understand the hover pseudo-class.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/css-visibility.php) - This page helped me undestand the difference between the css properties display and visibility.
